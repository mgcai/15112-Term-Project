Has a single player component and multiplayer component 
Single player is simply doodle jump, must jump as high as possible to get a highscore - not too interesting
Multiplayer component also has the goal of jumping to the top.
Can interact with other users by firing a bullet at others which will deal 5-15 dmg
Bullet will also deal a knockback which increases based on the damage already sustained throughout the game
Death will happen if you drop too far below the last platform jumped on
When dead, a screen appears and gives you your final score
